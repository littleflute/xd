The Lovable Leech

  As highly developed as we human beings like to think we are, the fact is that we are still dependent upon mny lower forms of life. The principal way that this is true, of course, is that we use meat for food and skins for clothing. But there are other ways, sometimes strange ways, that we rely on other creatures. Take, for example, the leech. It would be a challenge for anyone to really like a leech. It is a disgusting-looking worm that lives in freshwater ponds and streams. As many people have discovered when they've gone swimming, a leech's preference for dinner is human blood. It loves to attach itself to a swimmer's foot and sink in its teeth ---- as many as three hundred of them. The bite does not cause any pain. But the leech can suck out eight times its own weight in blood. "How disgusting," you are probably thinking. But listen to this. In recent years, doctors have found that leeches are the most suitable way to remove extra blood from a person after an injury, especially around the eyes. Yes, leeches are honored guests in many modern hospitals.
